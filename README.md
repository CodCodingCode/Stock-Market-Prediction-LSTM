Stock Price Prediction using LSTM
Overview
This project aims to predict the closing stock prices of Microsoft (MSFT) using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, a type of recurrent neural network known for its ability to remember long sequences of data. We leverage historical stock price data to train our LSTM model, with the goal of forecasting future prices based on patterns learned from the past. This README provides an overview of the project setup, including how to prepare your environment, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

Project Structure
MSFT (1).csv: The dataset containing historical stock prices of Microsoft.
model.py: Python script for creating, training, and evaluating the LSTM model.
requirements.txt: A list of Python packages required to run the project.
Getting Started

Data Preparation
The dataset MSFT (1).csv should be placed in the root directory of the project. It contains the historical closing prices of Microsoft stock, which the script will use to train the LSTM model.

Training the Model
Run the model.py script to train the model:

Copy code
python model.py
This script will preprocess the data, create the LSTM model, train it with the historical stock prices, and save the model's performance metrics and predictions.

Model Evaluation
The script outputs the model's performance on the test dataset, including a plot comparing the actual and predicted stock prices. Review these results to evaluate how well the model predicts future stock prices.

Features
Data preprocessing and normalization using MinMaxScaler.
Creating training and testing datasets with a specified historical window.
Building and training an LSTM model with Keras.
Evaluating model performance with mean squared error and visualizing predictions.
